# Periodic Table
A simple site showing the lanthanide and actinide sections of the periodic table. Clicking the name pops up and populates a modal with
information relevant to the clicked element. I used a CDN to get jQuery in so the site won't work offline, and I didn't use bootstrap
at all so that should be fine.
